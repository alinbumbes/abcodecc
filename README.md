The idea is to build it with lit-html, redux and tailwind while learning in the process. The issue with this there is limited information for lit framework and known issues. 

1. [ ] Make some basic components. A menu bar, a hero section, a footer and a page section. REAL basic, minimal styling. This will be main page. 

2. [ ] implement tailwind and rewrite everything to use it. 

3. [ ] Create a simple portfolio website: Glassmorphism style. [link](https://fa-glassmorphism-portfolio.netlify.app/) 
\- Add a menu bar that is not visible, only logo (left) and a hamburger menu (right)
\- Add a hero section with a title, description and a button on the left side, and a picture of a dude (me) on the right side. Animate as they come in to view, just a simple fade in, but first left side, then image. [link](https://dribbble.com/shots/16514975-Personal-portfolio-website)
\- There are 3-4 css round divs like balls that move randomly in the background. the background is also comprised of 2-3 large balls that have different colors and background has backdrop-filter so it's all like blurred glass. Maybe. dunno. 
\- add 3 glassmorphism cards with an icon, title, description and a button. [link](https://codepen.io/abcodecc)
